# my default Arch installation
This is my default install script on linux. I made 2 Versions, 1 for Arch-based Systems and 1 for Debian-based Systems.

A Version for Sound Systems will follow;) 


To get and run the script type the following in a terminal

    wget https://lab2k3.ddns.net/ljurk/initLinuxInstallation/raw/branch/master/installOnArch.sh
    chmod u+x installOnArch.sh
    sudo ./installOnArch.sh
    sudo nano /etc/inputrc
    uncomment:
    #set bell-style none
